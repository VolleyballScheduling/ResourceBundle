                The Volleyball Scheduling System was birthed from 
                a handmade custom DOS based system decades ago and 
                was revamped and revamped as technology advanced.  
                Now, mutated into an online multi-organization /
                facility system that can be managed and deployed
                from a central location and customized as needed.
